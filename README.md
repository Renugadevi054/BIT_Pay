🔐 BITPay
Secure Payment Gateway System for Institutional Transactions

BITPay is a full-stack web application that simulates a secure institutional payment gateway.
It demonstrates how authentication systems, payment workflows, and transaction management can be implemented in a structured and secure manner.

This project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of secure online transaction systems using Django.

📌 Project Overview

BITPay models a digital fee payment platform where:

Users authenticate through a restricted institutional domain

Payments are processed through a simulated card/UPI flow

Transactions are securely stored

Role-based dashboards manage access control

The system is designed to explore core backend concepts such as authentication, session handling, database modeling, and transaction logic.
